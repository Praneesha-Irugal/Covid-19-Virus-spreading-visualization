# Covid-19-Virus-spreading-visualization
##Simulate the spread of a virus, using covid-19 using NumPy and Matplotlib

First we Need to import  
```import matplotlib.pyplot as plt```       
```import matplotlib.animation as ani```

[using these for data visualization]  
  
And then we have to import  
```import numpy as np```

Below the colors that we can use for = uninfected, infected, recovered, dead
```
GREY = (0.78, 0.78, 0.78)  # uninfected
RED = (0.96, 0.15, 0.15)   # infected
GREEN = (0, 0.86, 0.03)    # recovered
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)          # dead
```
